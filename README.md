# KeyLogger (Still Working)
A keylogger project in Python involves developing a program that records all keystrokes made by a user on a computer keyboard. This program can run in the background, hidden from the user, and capture keystrokes from any application or website. The keystrokes can be saved to a file or sent to a remote location.
